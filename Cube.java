public class Cube {
    int side = 0; // It's good practice to use private fields for encapsulation.

    // Getter method for 'side'
    public int getSide() {
        return side;
    }

    // Setter method for 'side'

/*
  Create a public class called Cube without a constructor which gets one single private integer variable Side, 
  a getter GetSide() and a setter SetSide(int num) method for this property. Actually, 
  getter and setter methods are not the common way to write this code in C#. In the next kata of this series, we gonna refactor the code and make it a bit more professional...

Notes:
    There's no need to check for negative values!
    initialise the side to 0.
